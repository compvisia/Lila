<i>An easy to use lightweight game engine written in C++23</i>
</h4>

## Overview

Lila is an **experimental** game engine. It is primarily a learning project, but the very long-term plan is for Lila to evolve into a somewhat usable game engine.

## Requirements
- CMake â‰¥ 3.20
- C++23 compiler (e.g. GCC 14, Clang 17, MSVC 17.13)
- OpenGL 4.6

## Quick Start

Clone this repository and run the setup script to start configuring the engine.

```
git clone git@github.com:compvisia/Lila.git
cd Lila
```

Afterwards use these to build Lila and run the Application!
Windows:
```
"Scripts/BuildWindows.bat"
```
Linux:
```
./Scripts/BuildLinux.sh
```

**Lila** is designed to be usable on **Windows** and **Linux**. Any platform not mentioned is untested and currently not supported.
