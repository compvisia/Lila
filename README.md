## ðŸ’¡ Philosophy & Motivation

Lila is a game engine primarily used to learn about the process of creating a game engine. The very long-term plan is for Lila to be a somewhat usable game engine.

*Why was Lila created?*<br>
I, Youri, felt that the big three (Unreal, Godot & Unity) where amazing at creating games, but lacked features that I needed. 
Of course Lila is lightyears away from becoming one of the big three.
