<i>An easy to use lightweight game engine written in C++20</i>

## Overview

Lila is a game engine primarily used to learn about the process of creating a game engine. The very long-term plan is for Lila to be a somewhat usable game engine.

## Quick Start

Clone this repository and run the setup script to start build the engine.

```
git clone git@github.com:compvisia/Lila.git
cd Lila
./setup.sh --first-time
```

**Lila** is designed to be natively run on **Linux** but should run on Windows (Windows not tested!)
