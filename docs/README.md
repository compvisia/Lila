## 💡 Philosophy

Lila is a personal project that began in 2023, and it's currently being reworked from scratch. Mostly created to learn about game engines and to have a long term project to work on. This repository is free and open-source, and hopefully will help people to learn how to make a game engine too.

Lila is made to be easy to read, while still being optimized. Some things are going to change because we are always learning how to write better, cleaner and faster code.

Lila doesn't include an editor, but in the future there will be a repository for an editor plugin.
